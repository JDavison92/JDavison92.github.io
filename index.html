    <p>Skateboarding, snowboarding, and drawing...just a few things that helps Sebastian get through this thing called life. 
        Taking it one day at a time, one puff of a freshly lit joint at a time to hitting the resort or going on a long roadtip
        acroos America. Sebastian knows life is short and takes each moment in, letting those emotions show through these
        paintings of his world.
